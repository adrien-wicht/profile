    "abstract": "This paper assesses the sovereign debt management of emerging economies in terms of constrained Pareto efficiency. I derive a market economy in which a sovereign borrower trades non-contingent bonds of different maturities with a foreign lender. The borrower is impatient and lacks commitment. I show that the market economy cannot implement the Planner's constrained efficient allocation through defaults but instead by changes in maturity and costly debt buybacks. Moreover, as the lender must enforce those buybacks, the implementation often requires history-dependent strategies. Nevertheless, interpreting the borrower's impatience as a form of fading memory, small perturbations in the payoff of the market participants rule out any other strategies than Markov ones. In this case, the Planner's allocation can only be approximated by Markov debt management policies. I show that emerging economies such as Argentina and Brazil present evidence of such approximation albeit with different policies and outcome. In particular, conducting buybacks, the latter country comes quantitatively closer to constrained Pareto efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Sovereign countries do not necessarily repay all its creditors. There is a clear pecking order in which (official) multilateral lenders - i.e. the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - are given priority in repayment. Yet, this preferred status is a market practice and is not legally binding. This paper documents the implications of this de facto seniority structure of sovereign debt. Empirically, I present strong evidence that defaults involving  multilateral lenders are infrequent, last relatively longer and are associated with greater private creditors' losses. To rationalize those findings, I build a model of endogenous defaults and renegotiations. I show that the typical no-lending-into-arrear policy adopted by multilateral lenders can explain most of the aforementioned empirical facts. In addition, the de facto seniority generates important spillovers on other creditors and is a source of fiscal discipline. The borrower values the use of  multilateral debt and would not necessarily prefer other seniority regimes.",

    "abstract": "We develop an optimal design of a Financial Stability Fund that coexists with the international debt market. The sovereign can borrow defaultable bonds on the private international market, while having with the Fund a long-term contingent contract subject to limited enforcement constraints. The Fund contract does not have {ex ante} conditionality, but requires an accurate country-specific risk-assessment (DSA), accounting for the Fund contract. The Fund periodically announces the level of liabilities the country can sustain to achieve the constrained-efficient allocation. The Fund is only required {minimal absorption} of the sovereign debt, but it must provide insurance (Arrow-securities) to the country. Furthermore, with the Fund {all sovereign debt is safe independently of the seniority structure}; however, seniority of the Fund, with respect to the private lenders, may require a greater {minimal absorption} than a {pari passu} regime. We calibrate our model to the Italian economy and show it would have had a more efficient path of debt accumulation with the Fund.",

    "abstract": "We explore the complementarity between a central bank and a financial stability Fund in stabilizing sovereign debt markets. The central bank pursuing its mandate can intervene with public sector purchasing programs, buying sovereign debt in the secondary market, provided that the debt is safe. The sovereign sells its debt to private lenders, through market auctions. Furthermore, it has access to a long-term state-contingent contract with a Fund: a country-specific debt-and-insurance contract which accounts for no-default and sustainability constraints. The Fund needs to guarantee gross-financial-needs and no-over-lending. We show that these constraints, if they are binding at the steady-state, endogenously determine the optimal debt maturity structure that minimizes the Required Fund Capacity (RFC) to make all sovereign debt safe. However, the Fund may have limited absorption capacity and not be able to cover its RFC. But the central bank may be able to cover the difference, in which case there is perfect complementarity and the joint institutions act as an effective lender of last resort. We calibrate our model to the Italian economy and find that with of a Fund contract its optimal maturity is 3 years with a RFC of 125% of its GDP, above what the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) could reasonably absorb, but may be feasible with an ECB Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) intervention. In contrast, the average maturity of Italian sovereign debt has been circa 6.2 years, with a needed absorption capacity around 135% of GDP, which calls for a maturity restructure to ease the activation of TPI.",

A risk-averse borrower issues   long-term non-contigent bonds but cannot commit to its future selves to   repay. We characterize and solve for the Markov equilibrium of the dynamic   game with successive borrowers through a Euler equation with derivative on   future actions - i.e. a generalized Euler equation. We disentangle the effect   due to default and dilution of legacy creditors and show that the price and   policy functions exhibit jumps in various places. Taking the limit of finite   horizon, we show existence and uniqueness of the Markov equilibrium. We also   present conditions under which the price and policy functions are   differentiable almost everywhere.",

    "abstract": "We study the role of lack commitment in shaping the allocations of the canonical incomplete-markets sovereign default model of  Eaton and Gersovitz (1981).  We show how the equilibrium with commitment to the circumstances under which default can be undertaken involves a very different set of functional equations than in the equilibrium without commitment. It turns out that, in practice, under commitment default does not exist in all but very extreme quantitative environments. We document how the standard specification of Arellano (2008) displays no default if there is commitment, even in the absence of both utility cost and exclusion from borrowing. While less standard specifications can produce some default under commitment, we provide examples that demonstrate how rare default is. We interpret default as a recourse of last resort.",
