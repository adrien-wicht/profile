    "abstract": "This paper assesses the sovereign debt management of emerging economies in terms of maturity, buyback and default. I consider a market economy in which a sovereign borrower trades non-contingent bonds of different maturities with two foreign lenders. The strategic interaction between the lenders generates two Markov equilibria. The first one features buybacks at a premium and no defaults, while the second one predicts the opposite. The two equilibria can be Pareto ranked. In particular, the market economy can implement the Plannerâ€™s constrained efficient allocation through changes in maturity and premium-bearing buybacks. Defaults cannot substitute for such buybacks. In addition, the lenders must enforce the payment of the premium. Such enforcement might fail, though. I relate my findings to the experience of Argentina and Brazil since 1995. I estimate that the Brazilian government paid an average premium of 6% at issuance on its buyback operations. The model predicts that the debt management of Brazil is not constrained efficient yet more efficient than the one of Argentina. ",

    "abstract": "This paper studies official multilateral lending in the sovereign debt market. Official multilateral debt receives priority in repayment, even though this is not legally required. It represents an important portion of total sovereign debt and increases both before and during a default. Defaults on official multilateral debt are infrequent, last relatively longer and are associated with greater private lenders losses. I develop a model with private and official multilateral lenders where the latter benefits from a greater enforcement power in repayment. This allows the model to rationalize the aforementioned empirical facts and generates non-monotonicity in the private bond price. In small amount, official multilateral debt has a positive catalytic effect which is quantitatively strong but short lived. Sovereign borrowers value the use of official multilateral debt and would not necessarily prefer other seniority regimes.",

    "abstract": "We characterize the equilibrium of the standard sovereign   default model where a risk-averse borrower issues long-term   non-contigent bonds but cannot commit its future selves to repay. We   show existence and uniqueness of the Markov equilibrium of the   dynamic game with successive borrowers that is associated to this   environment.  We show that the price and policy functions exhibit   jumps and kinks in various places. A suitable choice of arbitrary   small noise yields price and policy functions that are   differentiable almost everywhere which allows us to characterize the   equilibrium using only decision rules of the agents by means of a   set of functional equations. Further, we describe the equilibrium   objects via an Euler equation with derivatives on future actions   -i.e. a generalized Euler equation (GEE) where the effects due to   default and those to dilution can be disentangled.  Computational   strategies using these functional equations allow for solving the   model with continuous functions using policy iterations. A   sufficient variance of the noise allows for concavity and hence   unique solution of the GEE which eases computation.",

    "abstract": "We study the role of lack commitment in shaping the allocations of the canonical incomplete-markets sovereign default model of  Eaton and Gersovitz (1981).  We show how the equilibrium with commitment to the circumstances under which default can be undertaken involves a very different set of functional equations than in the equilibrium without commitment. It turns out that, in practice, under commitment default does not exist in all but very extreme quantitative environments. We document how the standard specification of Arellano (2008) displays no default if there is commitment, even in the absence of both utility cost and exclusion from borrowing. While less standard specifications can produce some default under commitment, we provide examples that demonstrate how rare default is. We interpret default as a recourse of last resort.",

    "abstract": "We study the design a Financial Stability Fund under different provisions of incentives. More precisely, we generalize the flexible moral hazard approach of Georgiadis et al. (2024) in dynamic models and contrast it with the canonical dynamic moral hazard model of Atkeson and Lucas (1992). The provision of incentives under flexible moral hazard does not rely on the realized outcome. This has two main consequences. On the one hand, the optimal contract features bliss as opposed to immiseration. On the other hand, flexible moral hazard does not disrupt risk-sharing. We bridge the flexible and the canonical approach by back-loading incentives. This allows for perfect risk-sharing for spans of time (e.g. until limited enforcement constraints bind) and is a source of welfare gains for the borrower. We also analyze a restricted version of the flexible moral hazard. This framework provides a level playing field to compare the different Fund contracts. Our simulations show that restricted-flexible and canonical-back- loaded contracts are distinct but similar in their performance.",

    "abstract": "This paper derives the optimal fiscal and environmental policy under limited commitment. A government decides how to allocate resources between a polluting production technology and environment protection. There is a fixed environmental capital which stochastically depreciates with pollution and stochastically expands with environmental actions. The government can issue debt to finance its budget but cannot commit to any fiscal or environmental policy. I find that, in periods of financial distress, the government decides to deplete the environmental capital to avoid reduction in consumption. As the environmental capital depreciates stochastically with pollution, the government effectively gambles over the future state of the environment. I analyze recent shifts in the environmental policies of selected countries and connect them with a measure of fiscal tightness. There is evidence that such countries loosen their environmental policy when facing a larger fiscal burden.",
