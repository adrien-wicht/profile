    "abstract": "This paper explores the conditions under which sovereign debt buybacks are Pareto efficient, challenging the conventional view that such operations are detrimental to sovereign borrowers. Using a model of strategic lending, I show that buybacks can be rationalized as part of an optimal contract between a sovereign borrower and foreign lenders. In particular, buybacks allow bonds to function like Arrow securities. This is because they take place in the secondary market, where only legacy lenders operate, granting them market power, as opposed to the primary market, where new entrants ensure competitive returns. The model aligns with the recent empirical evidence in Brazil, including a premium paid on buyback operations. These findings offer insights into sovereign debt management and the implementation of optimal contracts. ",

    "abstract": "This paper studies official multilateral lending in the sovereign debt market. Official multilateral debt receives priority in repayment, even though this is not legally required. It represents an important portion of total sovereign debt and increases both before and during a default. Defaults on official multilateral debt are infrequent, last relatively longer and are associated with greater private lenders losses. I develop a model with private and official multilateral lenders where the latter benefits from a greater enforcement power in repayment. This allows the model to rationalize the aforementioned empirical facts and generates non-monotonicity in the private bond price. In small amount, official multilateral debt has a positive catalytic effect which is quantitatively strong but short lived. Sovereign borrowers value the use of official multilateral debt and would not necessarily prefer other seniority regimes.",

    "abstract": "We characterize the equilibrium of the standard sovereign   default model where a risk-averse borrower issues long-term   non-contigent bonds but cannot commit its future selves to repay. We   show existence and uniqueness of the Markov equilibrium of the   dynamic game with successive borrowers that is associated to this   environment.  We show that the price and policy functions exhibit   jumps and kinks in various places. A suitable choice of arbitrary   small noise yields price and policy functions that are   differentiable almost everywhere which allows us to characterize the   equilibrium using only decision rules of the agents by means of a   set of functional equations. Further, we describe the equilibrium   objects via an Euler equation with derivatives on future actions   -i.e. a generalized Euler equation (GEE) where the effects due to   default and those to dilution can be disentangled.  Computational   strategies using these functional equations allow for solving the   model with continuous functions using policy iterations. A   sufficient variance of the noise allows for concavity and hence   unique solution of the GEE which eases computation.",

We show the very different set of functional equations that appear under commitment relative to the standard ones. We document how in the standard yearly specification of Arellano (2008) with short-term debt there is no default if there is commitment to the circumstances of when to default. A bad enough disaster makes default under commitment appear. In contrast, with long-term debt, in the standard quarterly Chatterjee and Eyigungor (2012) environment commitment only to one-period-ahead default barely changes the no-commitment allocation, but commitment to both the one-period-ahead default circumstances and the one-period-ahead dilution, or commitment to a longer horizon (a year or a bit more) eliminates default completely and it is equivalent to commitment in the one-period-ahead default with short-term debt.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the design of a Financial Stability Fund under different provisions of incentives. Building a dynamic recursive contract, we generalize the flexible moral hazard approach of Georgiadis et al. (2024) in which an agent can freely choose the distribution of shocks next period. Unlike the canonical model of Atkeson and Lucas (1992), this approach provides incentives based on rewarding the agent's increased marginal costs - resulting in increased stochastic dominance - rather than its realized performance. As a result, the optimal contract features bliss as opposed to immiseration and the provision of incentives does not disrupt risk-sharing; in fact, risk-reduction is an optimal choice. We propose two ways of bridging the flexible and the canonical approaches by restricting the distribution set in the former and back-loading incentives in the latter, respectively. Building on Abraham et al. (2025) calibration of euro area stressed countries, we provide quantitative welfare comparisons of these different moral hazard frameworks: they can depend on how incentive compatibility and limited enforcement constraints interact. These findings offer insights for the design of new official sovereign lending programs.",

    "abstract": "This paper derives the optimal fiscal and environmental policy under limited commitment. A government decides how to allocate resources between a polluting production technology and environment protection. There is a fixed environmental capital which stochastically depreciates with pollution and stochastically expands with environmental actions. The government can issue debt to finance its budget but cannot commit to any fiscal or environmental policy. I find that, in periods of financial distress, the government decides to deplete the environmental capital to avoid reduction in consumption. As the environmental capital depreciates stochastically with pollution, the government effectively gambles over the future state of the environment. I analyze recent shifts in the environmental policies of selected countries and connect them with a measure of fiscal tightness. There is evidence that such countries loosen their environmental policy when facing a larger fiscal burden.",
