    "abstract": "This paper identifies the role of past history, maturity, buyback and default in the context of constrained efficient sovereign borrowing. I derive a market economy in which a sovereign borrower trades non-contingent bonds of different maturities with a foreign lender. The borrower is impatient and lacks commitment. I show that the market economy cannot implement the Planner's constrained efficient allocation through defaults but instead by changes in maturity and costly debt buybacks. Moreover, as the lender must enforce those buybacks, the implementation often requires history-dependent strategies. Nevertheless, interpreting the borrower's impatience as a form of fading memory, small perturbations in the payoff of the market participants rule out any other strategies than Markov ones. In this case, the Planner's allocation can only be approximated by the market economy through Markov debt management policies. Emerging economies such as Argentina and Brazil present evidence of such approximation albeit with different policies and outcome.",

    "abstract": "We develop an optimal design of a Financial Stability Fund that coexists with the international debt market. The sovereign can borrow defaultable bonds on the private international market, while having with the Fund a long-term contingent contract subject to limited enforcement constraints. The Fund contract does not have ex-ante conditionality, but it requires an accurate country-specific risk-assessment (DSA), accounting for the Fund contract. The Fund periodically announces the level of liabilities the country can sustain to achieve this allocation. The Fund is only required minimal absorption of the sovereign debt (nil, if sovereign debt is one-period), but it must provide insurance (Arrow-securities) to the country. The Recursive Competitive Equilibrium is constrained-efficient and, as part of it, the Fund announcement is realized. Furthermore, the seniority of the Fund contract, with respect to the privately held debt, is irrelevant. We calibrate our model to the Italian economy and show it would have had a more efficient path of debt accumulation with the Fund.",

    "abstract": "Sovereign countries do not necessarily repay all its creditors. There is a clear pecking order in which (official) multilateral lenders - i.e. the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - are given priority in repayment. Yet, this preferred status is a market practice and is not legally binding. This paper documents the implications of this \textit{de facto} seniority structure of sovereign debt. Empirically, I present strong evidence that defaults involving  multilateral lenders are infrequent, last relatively longer and are associated with greater private creditors' losses. To rationalize those findings, I build a model of endogenous defaults and renegotiations. I show that the typical no-lending-into-arrear policy adopted by multilateral lenders can explain most of the aforementioned empirical facts. In addition, the \textit{de facto} seniority generates important spillovers on other creditors and is a source of fiscal discipline. The borrower values the use of  multilateral debt and would not necessarily prefer other seniority regimes.",

    "abstract": "This paper characterizes the equilibrium of the standard incomplete   markets models with defaults and long-term debt. A risk-averse borrower issues   long-term non-contigent bonds but cannot commit to its future selves to   repay. We characterize and solve for the Markov equilibrium of the dynamic   game with successive borrowers through a Euler equation with derivative on   future actions - i.e. a generalized Euler equation. We disentangle the effect   due to default and dilution of legacy creditors and show that the price and   policy functions exhibit jumps in various places. Taking the limit of finite   horizon, we show existence and uniqueness of the Markov equilibrium. We also   present conditions under which the price and policy functions are   differentiable almost everywhere.",

In particular, we find a positive association between the current account and the share of a populationâ€™s prime-age individuals and a negative association with the share of the elderly. Our forecast suggests that, given the dramatically aging population in most industrialized countries, demographics will likely decrease the current account balance in the near future in those countries.",
