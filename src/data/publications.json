    "abstract": "This paper assesses the sovereign debt management of emerging economies in terms of maturity, buyback and default. I consider a market economy in which a sovereign borrower trades non-contingent bonds of different maturities with two foreign lenders. The strategic interaction between the lenders generates two Markov equilibria. The first one features buybacks at a premium and no defaults, while the second one predicts the opposite. The two equilibria can be Pareto ranked. In particular, the market economy can implement the Plannerâ€™s constrained efficient allocation through changes in maturity and premium-bearing buybacks. Defaults cannot substitute for such buybacks. In addition, the lenders must enforce the payment of the premium. Such enforcement might fail, though. I relate my findings to the experience of Argentina and Brazil since 1995. I estimate that the Brazilian government paid an average premium of 6% at issuance on its buyback operations. The model predicts that the debt management of Brazil is not constrained efficient yet more efficient than the one of Argentina. ",

    "abstract": "Sovereign countries do not necessarily repay all its creditors. There is a clear pecking order in which official multilateral lenders - i.e. mainly the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - are given priority in repayment. Yet, this preferred status is a market practice and is not legally binding. This paper documents the source and the consequences of the de facto seniority of official multilateral lenders. Empirically, I present evidence that defaults involving such lenders are infrequent, last relatively longer and are associated with greater private creditors' losses. To rationalize those findings, I build a model of endogenous defaults and renegotiations with heterogenous lenders. I find that the key component behind the de facto seniority is the typical policy of non-toleration of arrears adopted by official multilateral lenders. Combined with the default penalty, this policy rationalizes the aforementioned empirical facts, generates important spillovers on other creditors and is a source of fiscal discipline. The borrower values the use of  official multilateral debt and would not necessarily prefer other seniority regimes.",

    "abstract": "We characterize the equilibrium of the standard sovereign   default model where a risk-averse borrower issues long-term   non-contigent bonds but cannot commit its future selves to repay. We   show existence and uniqueness of the Markov equilibrium of the   dynamic game with successive borrowers that is associated to this   environment.  We show that the price and policy functions exhibit   jumps and kinks in various places. A suitable choice of arbitrary   small noise yields price and policy functions that are   differentiable almost everywhere which allows us to characterize the   equilibrium using only decision rules of the agents by means of a   set of functional equations. Further, we describe the equilibrium   objects via an Euler equation with derivatives on future actions   -i.e. a generalized Euler equation (GEE) where the effects due to   default and those to dilution can be disentangled.  Computational   strategies using these functional equations allow for solving the   model with continuous functions using policy iterations. A   sufficient variance of the noise allows for concavity and hence   unique solution of the GEE which eases computation.",

    "abstract": "We study the role of lack commitment in shaping the allocations of the canonical incomplete-markets sovereign default model of  Eaton and Gersovitz (1981).  We show how the equilibrium with commitment to the circumstances under which default can be undertaken involves a very different set of functional equations than in the equilibrium without commitment. It turns out that, in practice, under commitment default does not exist in all but very extreme quantitative environments. We document how the standard specification of Arellano (2008) displays no default if there is commitment, even in the absence of both utility cost and exclusion from borrowing. While less standard specifications can produce some default under commitment, we provide examples that demonstrate how rare default is. We interpret default as a recourse of last resort.",

    "abstract": "We study the optimal design of a Financial Stability Fund. The Fund contract is based on a risk-assessment of the country and it is subject to limited enforcement (LE) and moral hazard (MH) constraints, therefore risk-sharing is limited. We analyse this tradeoff and its interaction with the LE constraints, as well as the role that the sovereign's impatience plays. Our benchmark is a Fund contract where the incentive compatibility (IC) rewards & punishments take place every period. Then we proceed with two inquires: i) what are the losses of having IC contracts with long spans of consumption smoothing, where the IC rewards & punishments take place at the end of the span?, can the long-span contract be designed to achieve the effort and the welfare of the benchmark contract?; ii) we introduce conditionality. We show that unobservable (non-contractable) effort not only has an effect on the final distribution of the observable outcome (e.g. government liabilities), but also can help to fulfil an observable (and contractable) condition informative of the improvement of the risk profile of the country. We use this framework to assess the underlying rules of the New Stability and Growth Pact. ",
